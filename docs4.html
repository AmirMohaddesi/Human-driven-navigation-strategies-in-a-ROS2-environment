    <h1>Advanced Topics</h1>

    <h2>Map Merging and Coordination (Upcoming)</h2>
    <p>Future updates will include capabilities for merging maps from multiple robots into a single global map. This will enhance coordination and allow robots to effectively share exploration data and navigation tasks.</p>

    <h2>Heterogeneous Robot Integration (Upcoming)</h2>
    <p>Support for integrating different types of robots (e.g., drones, ground vehicles, manipulators) will be provided, enabling diverse robotic teams to collaborate effectively in complex scenarios.</p>

    <h2>Deployment on Physical Robots (Future Plans)</h2>
    <p>Our ultimate goal includes seamless transition from simulation to deployment on real robotic hardware, handling network communication, sensor data, and environmental unpredictability effectively.</p>

    <h2>Enhanced User Interface</h2>
    <p>Future releases will introduce user-friendly graphical interfaces and dashboards to simplify system configuration, operation monitoring, and multi-agent management.</p>

    <h2>Performance Optimization</h2>
    <p>As the scale of robot deployment increases, performance optimization through efficient resource management and optimized ROS2 configurations will be prioritized to maintain system responsiveness and reliability.</p>
