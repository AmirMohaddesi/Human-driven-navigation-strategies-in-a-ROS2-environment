# Multi-Agent ROS2 Platform Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Multi-Agent ROS2 Platform, designed specifically for scholars and researchers exploring robotics in disaster response scenarios. Built using ROS2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04, this platform provides an accessible environment for deploying and managing multiple TurtleBot3 robots for coordinated mapping, navigation, and exploration tasks.

## Getting Started

### Cloning and Building the Repository
Follow these steps to clone and build the platform:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/AmirMohaddesi/disaster_response_swarm.git  # Replace with your repository URL
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
```

### Launching a Multi-Agent Example
To run a basic multi-agent simulation:

```bash
ros2 launch disaster_response_swarm multi_agent_demo.launch.py
```

### Visualization with RViZ
Launch RViZ to visualize the robots and their sensor data:

```bash
rviz2
```

In RViZ, manually add the following displays for comprehensive visualization:
- Robot Model
- TF
- LaserScan
- Map

Ensure all displays are correctly configured for each robot namespace (e.g., `/tb3_0`).
